## E2E TestVM for the Network/Test Automation

This part of the site documents the *E2E Vagrant (TestVM) testing and development environment*.

It is split in two major parts:

- User guide
- Developer guide

If youâ€™re just getting started, it is highly recommended that you first read the [Quick Guide](https://gitlab.athmg.eecloud.dynamic.nsn-net.net/e2e/e2e-vagrant/blob/master/README.md) in order to start setting up the testing virtual machine.

If anything is unclear in these docs, please let us know by filing [an issue](https://gitlab.athmg.eecloud.dynamic.nsn-net.net/e2e/e2e-vagrant/issues).
