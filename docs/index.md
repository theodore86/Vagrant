## Vagrant TestVM (IaC)

This part of the site documents the *Vagrant (TestVM) testing and development environment*.

It is split in two major parts:

- User guide
- Developer guide

If youâ€™re just getting started, it is highly recommended that you first read the [Quick Guide](https://github.com/theodore86/vagrantenv#readme) in order to start setting up the testing virtual machine.

If anything is unclear in these docs, please let us know by filing an [Pull Request](https://github.com/theodore86/vagrantenv/pulls).
